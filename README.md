# Valheim Mod - Psytrance Events

Replaces the event music during base attacks with random psytrance tracks that alternate.

Downloads about 10MB at startup so it's not recommended for slow connections.

## Installation

Place **bin/Release/psytrance.dll** into your BepInEx plugins folder, typically located here:

    Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim\BepInEx\plugins
